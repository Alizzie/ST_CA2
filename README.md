# Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulation
This project was built during my studies in Ireland.

## Tasks:
- Create a self driving car simulation (using https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) while building a regression model
- During the training, the goal was to use as less data as possible, while achiving a high accuracy and fast speed.
- The data was collected manually, starting point was 3 laps in each direction for the first track (https://github.com/Alizzie/Data)
